# Changelog

## 0.2.3 — staged, unpublished

- **Attempt fencing.** Every run start advances a durable attempt generation stored on the
  job (`jobs.attempt_gen`, added additively on adoption). Writes made through `JobControl`
  (`transition`, `set_ext`, `progress`, `begin_submission`, `accept_submission`,
  `fail_submission`, `add_artifact`) carry that generation and are rejected with the new
  `stale_attempt` error (`STALE_ATTEMPT`, non-retryable) once a newer attempt owns the job.
- **Watchdog keeps ownership until fenced.** When the stall watchdog abandons an attempt, the
  runner fences it (`JobStore::fence`) before releasing the job lock. The abandoned worker
  thread can keep running, but its late writes no longer reach the job or its event stream.
- **Store API.** New `JobStore::{generation, fence, begin_run_fenced, transition_fenced,
  set_ext_fenced, record_error_fenced, refund_attempt_fenced, fail_fenced, complete_fenced,
  begin_submission_fenced, accept_submission_fenced, fail_submission_fenced, add_event_fenced,
  add_artifact_fenced}`. The unfenced methods are unchanged.
- Known gap: `JobControl::store()` returns the raw store, whose unfenced methods bypass the
  fence. Handlers must write through `JobControl`.
