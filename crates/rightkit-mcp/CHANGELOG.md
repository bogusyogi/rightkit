# Changelog

## 0.4.0 — staged, unpublished

- Bind the stdio launch configuration by value into the approval fingerprint: environment
  variable values now count, not only names. A changed `PATH` or `NODE_OPTIONS` is `Pending`.
- Fingerprint canonical form is version 2. All 0.3.x approvals are invalid; re-approve each
  workspace server once. Only the SHA-256 digest is stored; env values never reach the file.
- `PendingApproval` still exposes env variable names only.
