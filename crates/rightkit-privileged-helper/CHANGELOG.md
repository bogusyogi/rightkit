# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Breaking for dependents: dependency requirements `rightkit-app-manager` 0.1 -> 0.2. 0.1.1 was published before these requirements were raised; a semver-breaking dependency is a breaking change, so they ship as 0.2.0 instead of changing 0.1.1 in place (#1572). No source change in this crate since 0.1.1.

## 0.1.1 (unpublished)

- Unit tests and debug-assertion switches removed (Adrian, 2026-11-03: end-to-end tests only; no debug assertions). Release behaviour unchanged.

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

- First RightKit release, moved from Pulse (`pulse-engine`: elevate.rs).
