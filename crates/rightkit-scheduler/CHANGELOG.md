# Changelog

## 0.1.2 (unpublished)

- Requires `rightkit-agent-engine-protocol` 0.2.0, whose approval records carry the approvals core's `Binding` (mandatory digest) instead of an optional `payload_digest`. Decision 4 of the 2026-11-11 shape review (docs/audits/2026-11-11-shape-matrix/README.md, "Agent engine") taken on the recommended option, pending the owner's confirmation; design note: docs/audits/2026-11-11-shape-matrix/reports/agent-engine-contract-design.md.

## 0.1.1 (unpublished)

- Unit tests and debug-assertion switches removed (Adrian, 2026-11-03: end-to-end tests only; no debug assertions). Release behaviour unchanged.

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

- First RightKit release, moved from the CodeRight daemon scheduler model and bot profile types.
