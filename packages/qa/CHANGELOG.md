# Changelog

## 0.4.2 — 2026-10-11

- Add `QaBrowserSession.attach({ port | httpEndpoint, host?, allowRemoteHost? })` to attach to an app that already runs with a debugging port (reads `/json/version`; loopback only unless `allowRemoteHost: true`), `pages()` to list page targets, and `attachPage(targetId | predicate)` to attach to one without creating a target.
- An attached `QaPage` detaches on `close()` and never closes the app's target; closing an attached session detaches its pages only.
- Add `page.mouse` (`QaMouse`): `move(x, y, { steps? })`, `down({ button?, clickCount? })`, `up({ button? })`, with tracked position and held-button `buttons` masks. `page.click` and `page.hover` keep their event sequence and refuse to run while a mouse button is held.
- Document `evaluate` throwing on JavaScript exceptions (unchanged).

## 0.4.1 — 2026-10-10

- Depend on the published `@rightkit/qa-chrome` `0.1.3` exactly instead of `workspace:*`, so the source manifest matches the tarball dependency. No runtime change.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-08

- Add `QaBrowserSession`, `QaPage`, `QaElement`, `QaKeyboard` & typed `TimeoutError` using raw CDP over Node 26's native WebSocket.
- Support navigation, viewport/DPR, init scripts, JSON evaluation, selector/predicate waits, remote handles, real input & viewport PNG capture.
- Add mock transport regressions & real Chrome for Testing fixture coverage.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-08

- Breaking: WebdriverIO native lane & `right-qa` CLI are removed.
- Drive apps under test with Rust `rightkit-qa` + `rightkit-control` crates.
- Use `@rightkit/qa-chrome` for a test browser.
